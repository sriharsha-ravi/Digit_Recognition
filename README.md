# Digit_Recognition

# Problem Statement
A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. Suppose that you have images of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9 written by various people in boxes of a specific size - similar to the application forms in banks and universities.
The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 

# Objective
We are required to develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. Thus, this is a 10-class classification problem

# Approach
- Data Understanding
- Data Cleaning and preparation for Model building
- Build Model - Hyper parameter tuning
- Model Evaluation
